/**
Variables:
    cells //holds an array of Cell objects? Matt I think you were talking about using a hashmap. Feel free to change this
          //After thinking about the issue of changing the cell numberings, i think an arrayList might be our best bet, to begin with
Methods:

    addCell //adds a Cell object to the cells variable
    
    printData //creates file and writes each cell number with it's corresponding area
