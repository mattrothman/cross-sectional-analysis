//To do
//Create wrapper class "CellCollection" or something like that, holds a hashmap of cells, where key is the number label, value is the cell object
//Create cell class where each cell has global variables xpoints, ypoints, 
//and has methods inside(x, y)
//Create Traverser class that traverses image, from left to right, searching for cell
//Traverser class has globarl variables lastx, lasty that holds the last point that was checked for a cell,
//click_distance, and has method click() which calls autooutline after checking whether new location is inside()
//an already existing cell, and checkdiameter() which checks is a cell is large enough, addcell(), adds to cellcollection
//Preprocessing class makes the image grayscale or black and white
